# React Release System

This directory contains the release management system for React. It handles the process of building, testing, and publishing React releases across different channels and platforms.

## Architecture

    A --> D[prepare-release-from-npm.js]
    A --> E[utils.js]
    A --> F[shared-commands/]
    A --> G[publish-commands/]
    
    B --> H[Build System]
    C --> I[Publishing]
    D --> J[Release Prep]
    E --> K[Utilities]
    F --> L[Shared Commands]
    G --> M[Publish Commands]
```

## Release Channels

```mermaid

```

## Key Components

### 1. Build System (`build-release.js`)
- Release artifact creation
- Version management
- Build optimization
- Artifact validation

### 2. Publishing (`publish.js`)
- NPM package publishing
- Release channel management
- Version tagging
- Release notes

### 3. Release Preparation (`prepare-release-from-npm.js`)
- Release candidate preparation
- Version validation
- Dependency checking
- Release testing

### 4. Utilities (`utils.js`)
- Version management
- Dependency checking
- Release validation
- Error handling

## Release Process

```mermaid

    participant Dev
    participant Build
    participant Test
    participant Publish
    
    Dev->>Build: Prepare release
    Build->>Test: Build artifacts
    Test->>Publish: Validate release
    Publish->>Dev: Complete release
```

## Usage

### Release Management

```bash
# Build release
yarn build-release

# Publish release
yarn publish-release

Releases can be configured through:

- Command line options
- Environment variables
- Release channels
- Version numbers

## Release Types

1. **Stable Releases**
   - Production-ready
   - Long-term support
   - Backward compatible
   - Security updates

2. **Experimental Releases**
   - New features
   - Breaking changes
   - Development preview
   - Feedback collection

3. **Release Candidates**
   - Pre-release testing
   - Bug fixes
   - Performance testing
   - Compatibility checks
